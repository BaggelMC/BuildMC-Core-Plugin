# BuildMC-Core-Plugin Claim Data
# Join our discord server https://discord.gg/p8wBMZXAfb

# NOTE: You should not edit this file manually,
# because this file is used by the plugin to dynamically store team data

# Claim data is stored like this:
#team-id:
#  whitelist: # The list of players allowed to do anything on the claim without being part of the team
#    - player_uuid
#    - ...
#  # The default chunks-left amount can be configured in the config.yml
#  chunks-left: -1 # The amount of chunks this team has left to claim. If smaller than 0, the team has infinit claims.
#
#  # (Optional) Claims can store data strings using PersistentDataContainers
#  # This should be used from the API, so plugin developers can store their data in our team claims
#  data-container:
#    buildmc:test_pdc: "Hello, World!"
